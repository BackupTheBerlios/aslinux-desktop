'ASLinux Installer Interface' (aka poof2)
-----------------------------------------

poof2 is a simple front-end wrapper to ease the development of visual installer assistants.

The idea is to provide a visual interface to install 3rd party software that cannot be distributed in any
other way.

By example; look at skypeinstaller. Just need to download and install a package. Instead with dealing
with kdialog and kfmclient, you can get a nice progressbar, a screenshot, some text, and download any 
file you want all in one app.

poof2 can be controlled via dcop using some functions.
